# Contributing
New Contributors are always welcome. Start by having a look at the **README**, and review open [Issues](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cv32e20-dv/issues) with a "Good First Issue" label.

## Contributor Agreement
Most Contributors are [members](https://www.openhwgroup.org/membership/) of the
OpenHW Foundation and participate in one or more [Technical Task Groups](https://www.openhwgroup.org/working-groups/).
Membership is strongly encouraged, but not required.  Contributors must be
covered by the terms of the [Eclipse Contributor Agreement](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/ECA.php)
(for individuals) **or** the [Eclipse Member Committer and Contributor Agreement](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/committer_process/EclipseMemberCommitterAgreement.pdf)
(for employees of Member companies). The ECA/MCCA provides a legal
framework for a Contributor's technical contributions to the OpenHW Foundation,
including provisions for grant of copyright license and a Developer
Certificate of Origin on contributions merged into OpenHW Foundation repositories.

All pull-requests to OpenHW Foundation git repositories should be signed-off using the
`--signoff` (or `-s`) option to the git commit command (see below), although this is no longer strictly necessary.
